"Beastie Boys", "Beastie Boys Book", "The Beastie Boys use the methods finessed on their hugely-loved Grand Royal magazine to tell their own story: a life-affirming blitz of essays and stand-alone anecdotes – mostly by their two surviving members, but also co-travellers on their journey – honour the gonzoid spirit of the Beasties' canon, albeit laced with the humility of two music obsessives who can't quite get over how lucky they got.",https://twitter.com/petepaphides,"(PP)", http://www.ebbandflobookshop.co.uk/
"Chris Heath", "Literally & Vs America", "In 1989 and 1991 Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe allowed Chris Heath to be an ambient presence as they embarked on their first tours.

She's utterly aware of the person she was and the person she became, and the verve with which she guides you from the former to the latter is the purest of joys.

"Goldie","All Things Remembered", "Goldie’s autobiography rocks and swirls from unbelievable anecdote to intimate self-analysis and back again; if you’ve ever been in his company for more than two minutes, you’ll know his mind works in a wonderfully unique, free-wheeling way.

"Lloyd Bradley", "Bass Culture", "You can devote your entire life to reggae collecting and still not unearth every single amazing track recorded in a tiny section of Kingston during a period of a few years, but for both beginners and longtime fans, Lloyd Bradley's comprehensive history of reggae is an essential accessory.", https://twitter.com/petepaphides,"(PP)", https://www.foxlanebooks.co.uk/
"Mark Lanegan", "Sing Backwards and Weep", "Seriously, you don’t even have to be half a fan of the front man of the Screaming Trees to enjoy his autobiography. He stumbles from messed-up life experiences, heavy drugs, relentless score-settling, and unlovable madness in a raw and almost ridiculous way.

"Robert Forster", "Grant & I", "A story about the friendship that turned Robert Forster's teenage pop fantasy into a reality. Grant McLennan's tenure in The Go-Betweens was a consequence of the potential Forster saw in him. And the latter's tender telling of their escape from (and subsequent return to) Australia is surely an art-house buddy movie waiting to be made.", https://twitter.com/petepaphides,"(PP)", https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/robert-forster/grant-and-i-inside-and-outside-the-go-betweens

"Steve Hanley", "The Big Midweek", "Same as Dave says about Joy Division etc. So many great books about the Fall, not least those by Brix Smith, Dave Simpson and Si Wolstencroft, and Paul Hanley’s recent book about the making of the Hex Enduction Hour album. Steve Hanley’s is an incredible insider account of his year in the Fall, but also conjures so well what it’s like touring, being backstage and onstage in a band, and captures so many of the frustrations too. He survived!",https://twitter.com/Tim_Burgess ,"(TB)", http://www.route-online.com/all-books/the-big-midweek-life-inside-the-fall.html

"Tom Doyle", "Man On The Run: Paul McCartney in the 1970s", "As a biographer Doyle is quite Macca-like in his approach, the craft and cleverness in his writing is hidden and designed not to be noticed. This account of his first decade as an ex-Fab is empathetic but not uncritical. I tore through it. (PP) In a way, I felt it was easier to get into the head of Paul in ‘Man On The Run’, rather than with any Beatles books, because it showed you how he defined himself in the years immediately after The Beatles, and the character it took for him to do that.",https://twitter.com/eavie_rose, "(EP)", https://www.linghams.co.uk/
"Tracey Thorn","Bedsit Disco Queen", "Tracey’s a great writer; we knew that from her songwriting. This is first book, from a few years ago now; she can do books as well!

"Viv Albertine", "Clothes Clothes Clothes, Music Music Music, Boys Boys Boys", "She essentially starts off as a musician's girlfriend before forming The Slits and, by doing so, helps to start a movement (and influence several more). I love the way she just wings it and does everything in her own style – and the surrounding cast of characters is just amazing.",,"(EP)", http://www.ebbandflobookshop.co.uk/
"Vivien Goldman","Revenge of the She-Punks", "Thorough analysis of female music in the 20th and 21st century, reaching out as far as China and Russia. Fascinating on the way politics can impact on the music of each country. I love the connections she makes between, say, M.I.A. and Poly Styrene.
