Apart from meeting Yoko, the biggest experience of my life was hearing rock’n’roll and black rock’n’roll. The first music I got hooked on was blues. My earliest influences was Leadbelly, Robert Johnston, Sleepy John Estes, people like that. From that I went into Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry and the early R&B artists, whether they were rhythm & blues or rock’n’roll or whatever you’d call it then.

I did a \'You Are Here\' show at the Robert Fraser Gallery. It consisted of a bare gallery and a big white canvas that was round and it just had my writing on it: \'you are here\'.

You had to go down the stairs and you had to get through all these different charity cans to put money in - the room was full of them - and on the left side of the wall was this big, big canvas with \'you are here\', a hat to put money in for the artist and a jar of teeny white badges to take that said \'you are here\'.

My main education, apart from creatively, from Yoko, has been racism, because we\'re [an] intermarried, interracial couple, which, although we didn\'t realize at the time, has a lot of side effects. The racism was a real eye-opener for me, although I considered myself a liberal and whatever it was, you know, and understood these problems, but having lived it, it\'s a different ball game altogether.

It’s all yin and yang. It’s like breathing; you inhale and then you exhale, and then find balance. I think it just happens naturally. When I\'m strong, he tends to retire and vice versa. Some times we both have this vitality going.

It\'s just one of those things that just comes into your mind. I wasn\'t thinking anything. It suddenly just started running through my head: \'Just as tight as this, just as tight as that.\' And everybody has to read their own message.

John was trying to convey the message that we all play mind games. But if we can play mind games, why not make a positive future with it – to play a positive mind game?

‘Mind Games’ is such an incredibly strong song. At the time, people didn\'t quite get the message because this was before its time.

Now, people would understand it.

I don\'t think in those days people knew they were playing mind games anyway.
