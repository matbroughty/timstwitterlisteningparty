Stephen’s book is funny, informative, honest, but also very heartfelt (with a sequel due later this year). <a class="pure-button-active" href=" https://twitter.com/Mr_Dave_Haslam"><i

Steve Hanley’s is an incredible insider account of his year in the Fall, but also conjures so well what it’s like touring, being backstage and onstage in a band, and captures so many of the frustrations too. He survived! <a class="pure-button-active" href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Burgess "><i

This account of his first decade as an ex-Fab is empathetic but not uncritical. I tore through it. (PP) In a way, I felt it was easier to get into the head of Paul in ‘Man On The Run’, rather than with any Beatles books, because it showed you how he defined himself in the years immediately after The Beatles, and the character it took for him to do that. <a class="pure-button-active" href="https://twitter.com/eavie_rose"><i
